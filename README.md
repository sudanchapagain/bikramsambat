bikramsambat
============

a small program to fetch the current date in the Bikram Sambat calendar.

background
----------

in GNOME, i used the [nepali date by b_plab](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4518/nepali-calendar/), which
displayed the Nepali date on the top bar. i had gotten used to seeing it at a glace. however, in my tiling window
manager setup, where i switch between eww and waybar, i had to compromise. so i wrote this tool to bring that
functionality back as pinging bikramsambat binary via the bar configs is easy.
